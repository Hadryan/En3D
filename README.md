En3D is a large 3D human generative model trained on millions of synthetic 2D data, independently of any pre-existing 3D or 2D assets. 
This repo contains an implementation of En3D and provides a series of applications built upon it.

In addition, this repo aims to be a useful creative tool to produce realistic 3D avatars from seeds, text prompts or images. These generated avatars can be seamlessly animated and compatible with the modern graphics workflows. Here, We will also release a large-scale synthetic 3D human library and an action library for quick experience.
